    "desc" : "Sorry to say, but your love is as likely to bear fruit,  like a mango tree planted on an Antarctic glacier. There may be some chance, but it is very slim. Your love is like that which a parent with a newborn baby feels for sleep â€“ distant and beyond consideration. But that doesn't mean you can't be friends. Maybe destiny has someone else planned for you."

{
    "desc" : "There's probably something there. Just make sure your presence is known, so your feelings don't get squashed like a 4ft 8 inches NBA player. Your love is comparable to rush hour traffic. Slow and frustrating, but possible to navigate through persistence and sheer force of will. Be persistent, and maybe, you'll succeed someday. But don't feel bad if you fail, because love is not about holding on to things but an art of letting go."

    "desc" : "Good enough. Might as well check love off your list as you should have achieved it by now. This level of passion is equivalent to a cat's affection of boxes. It may not be immediately evident. But take a look in the box, and maybe, you might just find something, ready to jump out at you."

{
    "desc" : "Your love radiates as hot as the sun, blazing through the vastness of space, and searing itself into your being. Your love is as strong as that between an owner and their pet! Unyielding in its loyalty and comfort, albeit with less than optimal odours. There will be some minor problems and disagreements, but nothing too big to break the bond. You two are made for each other."
